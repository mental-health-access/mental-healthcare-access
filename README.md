# Mental Health Access

MHA is a website that makes finding mental healthcare easy for both English and Spanish speakers. A student project for LaunchCode's Liftoff course.

## Requirements

The current iteration of the site has been tested on Spring Boot v.2.4.4 and Java v.11

## Installation

You'll need be invited by Chris to the [MHA repository](https://github.com/chrisbay/mental-healthcare-access) to be able to clone this project.

After you're granted access, you can use git to clone the repository to your local machine.

You will have to create a new branch for each feature you will be working on, for example:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
```
Create a new branch with a meaningful name
```bash
git checkout -b fix-change-password-bug
```
You will then work on your task, and commit as usual. To merge with origin, you will have to create a pull request. You can read more about pull requests [here](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/git/git-workflow.html#pull-requests).

Make sure you assign your code for review, so it can be added to ```main```.
